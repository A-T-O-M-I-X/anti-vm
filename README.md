## Why we need universal way ?
Malware are now more clever than before. Before running, they check whether environment is virtual or real. 
But big problem they face, how to get an uinversal way to detect every type of VM ?
Most common is to search and match values from win32. But this method is static and for a limited versions of VMs. What if there are 1000+ VM manufacturers ? then you would have to write a code to match 1000+ VM signatures. But its time waste. Even after sometime, there would be new other VMs launched and your script would be wasted.

## Codes
Based upon tests, I have made tiny programs to detect windows and android VMs.

[Android code](android/anti-vm.b4a)

[Windows code](windows/anti-vm.cs)  

[Releases](https://github.com/Back-X/anti-vm/releases/tag/1)

## Stability
It is tested on many environments and is very stable.
- Detects Visrtualbox 
- Detects Vmware 
- Detects Windows Server 
- Detects RDP 
- Detects Virustotal 
- Detects [any.run](https://app.any.run/tasks/874cd411-5996-4e93-83d8-fdc72e95215a) 
- Detects [hybrid-analysis.com](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/3718df5b2fa478987b2bc5ea2fc260798b5bfa98814125e57b6f2ea4d10117a0/6066cafb89aba91a2115c14b) 
etc...
## Warnings
- Windows VM detection code can't detect hardware based VM's (like Hyper-V that accelerates in hardware e.g github workflow VPS), nor it supposed to. 
- Android VM detection code will detect tablet without radio as VM.
